AutoHotKey scripts to do tasks in Minecraft.

So far, we have:
- Ninja Bridging
- Breezily Bridging
- Wheat farming

To use these scripts:
Download AutoHotKey https://www.autohotkey.com/download/
Clone this repository to your machine.
Edit the programs you wish to use and change the path to where you stored the repo.
Double click the program in File Explorer to run it you wish to run it.
There should be a icon that pops up on the taskbar.
Most of the programs run when you click `Home` and stop when you click `End`. You can also reload the program with `Del`. Click `ctrl`+`alt`+`esc` to exit the program.

Some of the scripts don't work/are inconsistent. It would be much appreciated if anyone could make these scripts more reliable. Thanks.
